# SummitVR Launcher
_Supported on Windows x64_

Head over to the Releases section and download the latest .exe installer  
Your browser might tell you that it hasn't been downloaded enough and might be unsafe, we're working on it  
  
Run the installer once it's downloaded  
This time Windows might flag the process as being unsafe, we're working on that too  
  
Once the installer has finished it will open the SummitVR Launcher  
Next time you want to run the launcher, look for a shortcut on your **Start Menu** or your **Desktop**  
  
You can use the launcher to keep up-to-date with the current version of SummitVR, launch SummitVR, and in the future manage your account  
Also, the launcher will update itself automatically
